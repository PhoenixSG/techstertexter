# techstertexter
This repo is for outlining the main tasks which I have as a part of SOC-21, in the project- Techster Texter.

We all started with doing an introductory course to android app development on coursera- https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-app, where we learnt about creating the basic aspects of an app. I completed the course in the scheduled time and you can find the final app created and certificate in the repo.

Secondly, we started designing the overall look of the app. Here I designed several of the wireframes to better visualise what we were going for and make the app dev process more structured.
We also listed the various features, elements of the app in which I played a major role.

Then we went on to learning about firebase and how to connect our app to the database and use a real-time databse for implementing the basic chat features. I learnt about firebase from the following course- https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud0352

For just practice of the API part, I also created a simple android app showing weather of the city you enter the name of. This used a free API provided online. Again, code can be found in the repo.

Currently, I am working adding a new feature of group poll in the app.
